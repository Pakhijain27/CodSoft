## About
During my internship at **CodSoft**, I am working on developing small Python applications and utilities to solve real-world problems. This repository serves as a collection of those projects, providing hands-on experience and learning.

## Projects
Here are the Python projects in this repository:

1. **Rock Paper Scissors**  
   A simple implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game where you can play against the computer.

2. **Password Generator**  
   A tool that generates secure, random passwords based on user preferences (length, character types, etc.).

3. **Contact Book**  
   A simple contact book application where users can add, view, edit, and delete contact information.

4. **Simple Arithmetic Calculator**  
   A basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Each project is stored in its own folder with the necessary code and documentation.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `random` (for the Password Generator and Rock Paper Scissors game)
  - `os` (for file handling in the Contact Book)
  - `tkinter` (optional for GUI-based applications, if applicable)

## Installation
To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/codsoft.git
   cd codsoft
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (if any):
   If your projects require external libraries, they will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file (or you can install them manually using `pip`).

   Example:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Once you've cloned the repository, you can run each project individually.

### 1. Rock Paper Scissors
Navigate to the project folder and run the game:
```bash
cd rock-paper-scissors
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

### 2. Password Generator
Navigate to the project folder and run the password generator:
```bash
cd password-generator
python password_generator.py
```

### 3. Contact Book
To run the contact book:
```bash
cd contact-book
python contact_book.py
```

### 4. Simple Arithmetic Calculator
To run the calculator:
```bash
cd simple-arithmetic-calculator
python calculator.py
```
