**CodSoft Python Projects**

Welcome to the **CodSoft** repository! This repository contains Python projects developed during my internship at CodSoft. These projects include various simple applications to practice coding skills and showcase solutions to common programming challenges.

**About**
During my internship at **CodSoft**, I am working on developing small Python applications and utilities to solve real-world problems. This repository serves as a collection of those projects, providing hands-on experience and learning.

**Projects**
Here are the Python projects in this repository:

1. **Rock Paper Scissors**  
   A simple implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game where you can play against the computer.

2. **Password Generator**  
   A tool that generates secure, random passwords based on user preferences (length, character types, etc.).

3. **Contact Book**  
   A simple contact book application where users can add, view, edit, and delete contact information.

4. **Simple Arithmetic Calculator**  
   A basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Each project is stored in its own folder with the necessary code and documentation.
